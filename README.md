I am a cybersecurity researcher with a programming background, From developing web applications and breaking them I am very passionate about technology and computer science. With the experience and knowledge I gained from developing applications during my undergraduate days, I pursued cybersecurity in postgraduate for the challenge and interest. As a self-learner, I taught myself security concepts and I have also applied my skills in real time for developing web applications, security automation, vulnerability analysis, building cybersecurity tools like scanners, and other uses like building microservices (video transcoder). being both a programmer and a cybersecurity researcher gives me the upper hand in understanding the vulnerabilities better and more in-depth. which in turn allows me to find outstanding solutions.
